# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
We were to create a PseudoQueue class that is made up of two stacks and simulates how a queue behaves.

## Challenge
The major challenge of this was the Queues's dequeue because the "end" was at the bottome of the stack

## Approach & Efficiency
We chose a pop on and off method, which would be Time O(n) because it would have to pop on and off all the nodes in the stack.
Space is O(1) because we would only create a new node
