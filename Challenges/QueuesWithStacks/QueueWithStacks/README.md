# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
We were to create a PseudoQueue class that takes in two stacks (and the stacks take in nodes) that still acts like a queue.

## Challenge
The major challenge of this was the Queues's dequeue because the "end" was at the bottome of the stack

## Approach & Efficiency
We chose a pop on and off method, which would be Time O(n) because it would have to pop on and off all the nodes in the stack.
Space is O(1) because we would only create a new node
