# Graphs
Graphs are non linear data structures that I will make up out of nodes.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We were asked to create a class for graphs represented as adjacency lists. 


## Approach & Efficiency
I utilized
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
The abilities of this class are: 
- AddNode: adds a node to the graph
- AddEdge: adds an edge between two nodes
- GetNodes: returns all the nodes in the graph
- GetNeighbors: returns the neighbors of a node
- Size: returns the number of nodes in the graph
