//Write tests to prove the following functionality:

//Node can be successfully added to the graph
//An edge can be successfully added to the graph
//A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
//All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
//Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
//The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
//A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
//An empty graph properly returns null
